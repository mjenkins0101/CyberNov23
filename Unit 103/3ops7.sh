# Take care to only perform this operation in user-created directories. Changing permissions in system files/directories is not advised, as this can cause malfunctions in the OS.

# Create a new bash script that performs the following:

# Prompts user for input directory path.
# Prompts user for input permissions number (e.g. 777 to perform a chmod 777)
# Navigates to the directory input by the user and changes all files inside it to the input setting.
# Prints to the screen the directory contents and the new permissions settings of everything in the directory.

echo "enter a file"
ls
read file

echo "enter permission number 777 or 770"
read Num
chmod $Num $file
echo "You granted permsion to $file"
ls -1 $file
